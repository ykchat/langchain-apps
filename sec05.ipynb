      "So far, all the chains and agents we've gone through have been stateless. But often, you may want a chain or agent to have some concept of \"memory\" so that it may remember information about its previous interactions. The clearest and simple example of this is when designing a chatbot - you want it to remember previous messages so it can use context from that to have a better conversation. This would be a type of \"short-term memory\". On the more complex side, you could imagine a chain/agent remembering key pieces of information over time - this would be a form of \"long-term memory\". For more concrete ideas on the latter, see this awesome paper.\n",
